# GrowthLink-Intern-Titanic-Survival-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

# **Summary**

To build a machine learning model to predict Titanic passenger survival based on features like age, gender, ticket class, and fare. The process involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical data. The model should be evaluated using metrics like accuracy and precision. The final deliverable is a well-structured GitHub repository containing the code, preprocessing steps, model selection, and performance analysis.
